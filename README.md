# Discord.py Modmail Bot (Basic)

From: Matthew's Development

This is a basic form of a Modmail bot for Discord that I have made open sourced back in 2022 and was used back in around the 2020-2021 era before I was very interested in making Discord bots. This was originally made when I lacked knowledge of discord.py. Since I learned discord.py better then back in 2020-2021, I made this better and I decided to release this for people who want to use this.

## HOW IT WORKS:

First, a person can DM the bot and that message will be sent to your #modmail channel. To reply back, you have to mention the user with your message. ex: "@MemberMention Hi" This version now shows the user id in the modmail channel so you can easily reply back to them with the <@UserID> method instead of straight mentioning it.

This is how replies should look: <@UserID> your message here"

## SETUP GUIDE:

Here is a guide to set up this basic modmail script. Perfect for Beginners. No extra discord server required so no need to have a seperate staff server.

1. Fork/Download this source code
2. Install everything from requirements.txt (Command is: pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. Create a Discord bot in https://discord.com/developers/applications (make sure you enable the message content intent and make sure you copy the bot's token)
4. Fill in everything in the .env.example file and rename .env.example to .env
5. Make a discord text channel called: #modmail (You can use the setupmodmail command to set this up for you.)
6. Run the Bot (Command is: python main.py)
